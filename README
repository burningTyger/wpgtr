  "Quite so," he said.  "I went out to my car yesterday and there was a shoe in the passenger's
  seat.  A very battered oxford.  Looking straight ahead like it needed a lift to the cobbler's.

You're pulling down your own master copy of my first book, a book I'm gallantly pursuing,
coding and drawing, tying into a bundle with wax and twine.  This master copy is yours.  You
can do most anything with it, I just ask you abide by the very simple and rather liberal
license for this text.  (See the 'deed' portion of poignant.yml.)

=== Building HTML ===

You will need to install RedCloth. <http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/>

To build the HTML version of this book:

  ruby poignant.rb /path/to/output

The script isn't very full-featured.  Please send me patches.

=== What This Package Includes ===

  poignant.yml: The YAML text of the entire book.  The entire book has been written using
    Vim as my word processor and YAML as my document format.  I also use Textile liberally
    throughout the content.

  poignant.rb: The script which formats output for the book.  Currently, it only outputs
    HTML and CSS.

  index.erb: An ERb template for the table of contents.

  chapter.erb: An ERb template for the chapter pages.

  expansion-pak.erb: An ERb template for expansion pages.

  guide.css: A CSS file with fonts and colors.

  i/: The images folder.  Contains images at no larger than 800px.  These images are
    designed for the website.  Eventually, I will add a folder with 300dpi images.
